# Usage

Source directory must have this structure:

    _audio/
        file_blah.mp3
        file_blahblah.ogg
        ...
    some_tag_name/
        foo.md
        foo.cover.jpg
        bar.md
        bar.cover.png
        ...
    some_other_tag_name/
        ...
    ...
    origfp2thumbfp.json (auto-generated by this script, but don't modify it)
    tag-heirarchy.txt (optional)
    screeds.yaml

`screeds.yaml` is a key-value dictionary for tag (key) to description (value), for example:

    some_tag_name: "Some description here."
    some_other_tag_name: "Blah blah blah..."
    ...

`tag-heirarchy.txt` is optional. It is structured as a **tab**-indented file, and it describes how children inherit ancestor tags. In the following example, `ww2-eastern-front` has ancestor tags `germany, russia, european-country, country, ww2, war, politics`:

    country
        european-country
            france
            germany
                ww2-eastern-front
            italy
            russia
                ww2-eastern-front
        asian-country
            china
            japan
            south-korea
            indonesia
    war
        ww1
        ww2
            ww2-eastern-front
        iraq-war
        afghan-war
        vietnam-war
    politics
        war
