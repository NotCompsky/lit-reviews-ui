# Usage

Source directory must have this structure:

    _audio/
        file_blah.mp3
        file_blahblah.ogg
        ...
    some_tag_name/
        foo.md
        foo.cover.jpg
        bar.md
        bar.cover.png
        ...
    some_other_tag_name/
        ...
    all/
        something.md
        something.cover.webp
        ...
    ...
    origfp2thumbfp.json (auto-generated by this script, but don't modify it)
    tag-heirarchy.txt (optional)
    config.yaml

For each tag in `main_tag_descriptions` (below), any content within the corresponding directory will have that tag automatically applied to the content. Other directories are ignored, except for `all/` which is for any other content.

***

`config.yaml` must have this structure:

    title: Some Title Here
    initial_checked: book
    audio_root_directory: null # If a markdown file's prefix's "music=<path>" uses a relative path, this is the parent directory
    html_head_postfix_stuff: "" # optional
    html_body_prefix_stuff: "" # optional
    html_body_postfix_stuff: "" # optional
    display_groups:
      - [[movie, Movies], [tv-show: TV], [youtuber, Youtuber]]
      - [[art, Art], [book, Books], [board-game, Board Games], [video-game, Video Games]]
      - [[animal, Animals], [place, Places], [food, Foods], [ui-idea, UI]]
    main_tag_descriptions:
      some_tag_name: "Some description here."
      some_other_tag_name: "Blah blah blah..."

Only each tag listed in `main_tag_descriptions` must have its contents in a subdirectory named the tag name. Only these contents are included in the final output.

`display_groups` is useful for partitioning items into a few large groups.

***

`tag-heirarchy.txt` is optional. It is structured as a **tab**-indented file, and it describes how children inherit ancestor tags. In the following example, `ww2-eastern-front` has ancestor tags `germany, russia, european-country, country, ww2, war, politics`:

    country
        european-country
            france
            germany
                ww2-eastern-front
            italy
            russia
                ww2-eastern-front
        asian-country
            china
            japan
            south-korea
            indonesia
    war
        ww1
        ww2
            ww2-eastern-front
        iraq-war
        afghan-war
        vietnam-war
    politics
        war
